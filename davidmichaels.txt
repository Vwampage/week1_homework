Name: David [middle names redacted under section 203 of the UPDOG act of 1999]

Expectation: I'm looking to get the concepts of computer science nailed down so that I can start to build sweet websites/apps that do nifty things. Also scripting. Scripting is going to be super important.

Occupation: My current occupation is Office MacGyver for Signal. This past week that has been Raging Against The Wifi. Sometimes it involves servers in Japan. Other times it involves cables in walls.

Fun fact: I can captain a whitewater raft down a class 3+ river without any grievous injury.

App idea: If I could build any app I wanted? A true point A to point B travel app. So, your house to your friend's house in Washington DC. No one yet does that.
